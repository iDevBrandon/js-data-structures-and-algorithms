Objects [] in JS are like a type of hash table. They

basket.grapes = 1000;

key value
''grapes'  
key is used where it stores

it's done by Hash function
comes a key into an index
1000 is stored in memory

75. Hash function
    a function that generates a value of fiexed length for each input

like md5 Hash Generator/ SHA-256 hash generator

give it an input and the function generates some random pattern

idempotent

we get really fast data access. To find grapes or basket

give it a key and know where the item is

hash something really fast and map

76. Hash Collisions
    inserting phone number of user and stores both keys and values. become the same address.

O(n/k) k is the size of hash table.


82. Hash tables VS Arrays 
The problem of hash tables that idea of no concept of orders while in arrays, each item was placed next to each other on a shelf in memroy.
