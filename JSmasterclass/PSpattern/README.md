26. Intro to Problem Solving Patterns

some patterns 

Frequency counter 
multiple pointers
sliding windows
divide and conquer 
DP(Dynamic Programming)
greedy algorithms 
Backtracking 


27. Frequency Counter 
This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values.

THis can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings 


30. Multiple pointers 
Create pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain codition 

Very efficient for solving problems with minmal space complexity as well
