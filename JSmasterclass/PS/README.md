18. Introduction to Problem Solving 

Define what an algorithm is 
Devise a plan to solve algorithsm 
Compare and contrast PS patterns 

What is an algorithm 
A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task. 

Why do i need to know this?
programming invloves some kind of algorithms 
It's the foundation for being succesful PS devleoper 

How do you improve?
1. Devise a plan for solving problems 
2. Master common problem solving patterns 

Problem solving 
Understand the problem andexplre concrete examples 
Break it down 
solve/simplify 
Look back and Refactor 

19. Step 1: Understand the problem 
1. Can i restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Cna the outputs be determined from the inputs? 
5. How should i label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem? 

Write a funciton which takes two numbers and returns their sum?

1. implement addition  
2. Int? float? What about string for large numbers?
3. int? float? string?
4. what if someone pass only one number?
5. 


20. Step 2: Concrete Example 
face a problem - write simple exampels wiht input and output 
Progress to more xomplex examples 
explore examples with empty inputs 
explore exampels with invalid inputs 

write a function which takes in a string and return coutns of each character in string 

charCount('aaaa'); // {a:4}
charCount('hello'); // {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1}
charCount("") // empty space 

21. Step 3: Break it down 
communicate what ur doing 
like here's some steps i gonna take ~~ 
Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.


22. Step 4: Solve or Simplify
Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do 
Templorarily igonore that difficulty 


23. Look back & refactor 
Can you check the result 
can you derive the result differently?
can you understand it at a glance? 
Can you use the result of method for some other problem?
Can you improve the performance of your solution?
Can you think of other ways to refactor? 
How have other people solved this problem?
